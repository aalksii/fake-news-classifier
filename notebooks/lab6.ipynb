The CUP s claim of betrayal reveals the shaky political foundations upon which Catalonia s independence movement is built , a jumble of parties ranging from anti -capitalists to free marketeers whose only common cause is to split from Spain .

      "Prompt: Here is the context: Revamping the U . S . tax code has become a new legislative test for President Donald Trump after a Republican push to repeal former President Barack Obama s signature healthcare law failed last month in a humiliating defeat for the party . The U . S . tax code is riddled with narrow subsidies and loopholes , many of them deeply embedded in the economy and defended by the interests they benefit , such as the mortgage interest deduction and the business interest deductibility . The bill significantly lowers the income tax rate for U . S . companies - to 21 percent from 35 percent - allows them to repatriate cash from overseas , and modifies numerous deductions , among other changes . We re trying to deliver great tax reform to the American public . Among its key elements , Brady s proposal would cut the U . S . corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent , permit immediate deductions for capital investment and introduce a border adjustment tax system that would tax imports into the United States but not tax revenue generated by exports out of the country . This cannot be the intended impact from a Congress who has worked for years to enact a more globally competitive tax code . Companies in the U . S . pharmaceutical and medical research industry plowed about 17 percent of total revenue into R D in their most recent fiscal year , according to Thomson Reuters data . Under the bill , millions of Americans would stop itemizing deductions , putting tax breaks that incentivize home ownership and charitable donations out of their reach , but also making tax returns somewhat simpler and shorter . As part of the new tax code , U . S . multinational companies could bring back some of the estimated 2 . 6 trillion in business profits they have overseas and the Treasury Department could benefit from the taxes on the repatriated money . Under a new territorial system , the bill would exempt U . S . corporations from taxes on most of their future foreign profits . It would also lower the top U . S . corporate tax rate from 35 percent , the highest in the industrialized world , to 20 percent , as well as shift to a territorial style tax system aimed at exempting the earnings of American companies abroad from U . S . taxation .. Here is the question: What does the new U.S. tax code target?. Here is the answer to this question:\n"

      "Prompt: Here is the context: SAN FRANCISCO Reuters - Apple Inc , Alphabet Inc s Google and Facebook Inc are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U . S . President Donald Trump s controversial travel ban , deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order . Apple has retained two prominent , free -speech lawyers to do battle with the government , according to court papers Theodore Olson , who won the political -speech case Citizens United v . The legal battle between the FBI and Apple briefly united many around the idea that Congress - not the courts - should decide the issue . Other tech giants such as Facebook Inc FB . O , Twitter Inc TWTR . N and Alphabet Inc s GOOGL . O Google have rallied to support Apple . The high court said then that the All Writs Act , a law from 1789 , authorized the order , and the scope of that ruling is expected to be a main target of Apple when it files a response in court by early next week . When the Federal Bureau of Investigation took Apple to court in February to try to open the iPhone in its investigation of the San Bernardino slayings , the cause gained traction in Washington . But Apple will likely also broaden its challenge to include the First Amendment s guarantee of speech rights , according to lawyers who are not involved in the dispute but who are following it . Apple fought back , arguing , among other things , that only Congressional legislation could authorize what the court was demanding . In addition , the iPhone in dispute was owned not by Farook but by his employer , a local government , which has consented to the search of the iPhone . Government lawyers from the U . S . Justice Department have defended their request in court papers by citing various authorities , such as a 1977 U . S . Supreme Court ruling that upheld an order compelling a telephone company to provide assistance with setting up a device to record telephone numbers ..
